This folder is largely the Faddeeva Package by Steven G. Johnson (http://ab-initio.mit.edu/Faddeeva)

+ an attempt to modify it to directly provide the function Voigt based on it.

Modified files (compared to Faddeeva Package):

Faddeeva.cc and Faddeeva.hh (included separate Voigt profile function, for real arguments and real output)

added files:

Faddeeva_Voigt_mex.cc
Faddeeva_Voigt.m
Faddeeva_Voigt_build.m
